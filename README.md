Instructions for using the script are located within it as a giant comment. The process is somewhat complicated and involves downloading multiple google sheets as csv files, changing numerous configuration variables, multiple runs and edits and reruns of the make_racing_bar_chart.py script, and much more, so read the instructions carefully. 

The csv files generated by the script that can be uploaded to flourish.studio will be located in the generated_files directory.
